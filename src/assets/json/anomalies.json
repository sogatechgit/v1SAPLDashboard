The purpose of this report is to address questions discussed on September 11, 2014 on the subject of spalling.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis (RCA):\nFMCTI has an ongoing Root Cause Analysis (RCA) investigation to address spalling. The evidence of this occurrence is during post FAT testing. Current theory suggests, the spalling indication occurs after valves are stroked under full differential pressure (i.e. 10 ksi blowdown cycles) and the size of anomaly does not appear to increase when the valve is repeatedly cycled. The spalling indication is localized to the 12 and 6 o\u0027clock positions located on the transition from seat sealing surface to seat production bore ID. The transition area is exposed to flowing wellbore fluid as such this area is exposed to normal wear and tear during the life of the valve.\n\nStandard Process:\nIt\u0027s important to note that Prelude and several other projects of similar build, following FMC standard processes, have passed all FAT tests which verify gate and seat integrity of the sealing surface between the gate and seat. Recently, spalled seats were identified on Prelude XT#3 and a small number of loose valves. For Prelude and several other projects, this anomaly did not affect FAT test and;\nspalling was virtually unknown until it was identified as a variable that may have been a contributing factor to one customer failing to pass their FAT test using an alternate assembly step which was not consistent with Prelude or other FMC projects.\n\nPrelude Intervention Inspections:\nThe Shell Asia Pacific team was alerted of Spalling on another projects valve. As a reaction to other project findings, FMCTI performed video inspections on all Prelude 7 trees and manifolds valves as part of the data review. These video inspections have shown some limited spalling indication in four seats in three valves, two loose Manifold valves and one PSV on XT3.It\u0027s important to note that all of Prelude equipment has met all agreed FMCTI, Shell, and Industry requirements including FAT and EFAT. Thus, FMCTI has concluded that production shipments should continue as normal after successful FAT testing.","ident":"20141014","clr":1},{"aid":116,"loc":"aaaa","id":134,"ref":"19-0072","tit":"Repeat issues with MEG line low pressure to P1, P3, P5 and P7.","desc":"General observation. for information only.\nRepeat issues with MEG line low pressure to P1, P3, P5, P7 and P8 due to leaks and high dP topside.

When the monitoring device was initially installed, by the commissioning personnel, the device clashed with the misaligned hole cut in the pipe preventing plug from being fully installed in to the fitting, the commissioning team have then appeared to try to force the monitoring device causing the deformation of the fittings internals. (It is estimated the clash was approximately 5 turns in. A minimum of 14 turns are required to fully install the plug and compress the primary packing seal). \n\nThe commissioning personnel have then incorrectly identified the issue being with the internal threads of the fitting and not the clash with the misaligned hole in the pipe. The thread tap has been incorrectly used and has been utilised with too much force which has cut approximately 2 to 3 threads in the internal of the fitting. This has caused the burr that was noted by site and Cosasco personnel during the last visit. The damage to the socket adaptor on the 18” RBS Retrieval Tool that was present in the turret gives further indication the monitoring device and thread tap have been installed using excessive force.\n\nCommissioning personnel then attempted to install a carrier plug into the damaged fitting using excessive force which caused further damage to the internals and the internal sealing face.\n","ident":"20180926","clr":1},{"aid":650,"loc":"aaacacaaad","id":211,"ref":"21-0006","tit":"Annulus Pressure Design Limit Exceedance","desc":"Annulus pressure for Riser 8 Annulus exceed the recommended limit of 0.5 barg, reaching the value of 1.143 barg.","ident":"20191001","clr":1},{"aid":651,"loc":"aaacacaaadabae","id":129,"ref":"19-0067","tit":"Riser 8 Heel Anchor chain to the heel anchor clamp, uneven chain tension","desc":"On 29/11/2020, during the 2020-C1 campaign, the chain tensions were viewed on RHA 08 and found to be similar to the Sep 2019 angles.

The project team proposed a technical derogation to allow an increase in the upper temperature limit from 120°C to 130°C for AISI 316L stainless steel (316L) applied as cladding for the carbon steel flow lines. From the Prelude field slightly sour gas will be produced. The proposed operating conditions in the flow lines and the composition of the production stream are 29 bar CO2, 6,5 mbar H2S and 8,400 mg/L chloride.   \n The Prelude project team selected 316L metallurgical cladded carbon steel flow lines as a lower cost alternative to the base-case material selection of alloy 625 cladded carbon steel. For Prelude, strain-based design is applied, which increases the risk of Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) on the exposed Corrosion Resistant Alloy (CRA) cladding.  \n  \nThe Shell DEP 39.01.10.12 – “Material Selection for Upstream Facilities – Equipment” states that the maximum temperature for which 316L clad carbon steel is currently qualified is 120°C. For Prelude the maximum inlet temperature for the flow lines is 130°C. The other selection parameters (chloride content and partial pressure H2S) are within the specified limits of the DEP. In the absence of proper data to support the application of 316L at 130°C, for reeling and strainbased design, the Prelude Project team requested Shell PTE/EMMI to perform qualification tests for SCC resistance.   \n  \nThe Prelude project team listed the expected worst-case formation water composition and operating conditions for the Prelude field, as input for the selection of the test conditions. Stress, strain and work hardening are known to affect the susceptibility of CRAs to SCC. Prior to and during actual production, the flow lines will be exposed to mechanical loads above yield. As a result of installation by reeling, the maximum total deformation will be 2.0%. In strain-based design, a maximum total deformation of 2.25% is allowed during operation. These aspects were taken into account in the qualification tests.   \n  \nThis report describes the testing procedure for and the test results of the evaluation of the SCC resistance of a 316L clad flow line under the Prelude field conditions. It is noted that pitting resistance for the Prelude flow lines has been covered in another study and is not part of this work. (ref.

Accumulated flow to OPEN and CLOSE were in line with expectation ~6.7L at this time.\n - MBV6A has remained closed since April 2019, with P6 well flowing to FL3 (via MBV6B) until suspected choke damage in early February 2020.\n - MBV6A passed leak-off test (LOT) with 4 hour hold period on 4 August 2020 (in preparation for impending P6 flow module replacement campaign).\n** EVENT: Panel then attempted to open MBV6A to conduct LOT of PSDV. At this point, a valve position alarm occurred. Accumulated flow was ~0.45L vs \u003e6.6L for correct valve function. Trends indicate the valve did not OPEN at this point.\n - A number of attempts have been made to cycle the valve between 4th and 1th August.\n   - - Accumulated flow has steadily increased from 0.45L to 1.25L (OPEN), and 0.62L to 1.55L (CLOSE) through cycling of the valve.\n   - - Accumulated flow appears to increase by a larger amount, the longer the valve is left with OPEN command.\n - Accumulated flow on valve closure has been higher than on opening, with the differential increasing the longer the valve is left in OPEN position. Indicating that valve continues to slowly creep OPEN after flow drops below flow meter minimum, and actuator spring assists to drive valve to CLOSE position.\n - Since 8 August PM, pressure trends indicate valve has achieved enough travel to allow some flow past.\n - A key potential cause is a restriction due to hydrate. MEG was injected via CIT2 for 2.5 hr prior to well shut-in, and FA believes hydrate risk since this point was low.\n - From SmartTool valve signatures, command and report logs, vendor is ruling out potential DCV issues.\n - Vendor is currently reviewing SSH data for higher resolution vs. PI data.\n - RESOLUTION: Valve successfully opened when executing TWI-399 to revalidate PSDV LOT.
